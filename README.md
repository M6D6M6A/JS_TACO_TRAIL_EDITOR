### Introduction

The website is intended for editing and resaving Guild Wars 2 TacO paths. For this the website uses only Javascript, HTML and CSS and works completely client sided to reduce the load on my server. My website only provides the code that can be found here, the website can also be easily downloaded from GitHub to run completely local on the PC.
